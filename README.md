# Concept ideas; 

I want to create a variation of the agar.io game adapted for american politics. The game basically consists on selecting what party do you support, it can either be republicans or democrats. Further on the game will assing you the main representative of that political party, your mission (if you accept it) is to try and get bigger by "eating" other members of your political party. But there is a challenge! The names and the political party of every member will be private! So you will need to guess who is who into the american politics scene!

If you eat memebers of other political partys you will reduce your size inmediately and loose health, if you end up getting less size than the starter default size you will be terminated!

Are you ready?

Im also thinking on creating a last minute concept idea that will dratically change the concept of the game ex; instead of posticians i do it with birds. 


## Ideas for the name; 

-> "Know your politicians"
-> "Agar.gov"



## Update on the day to day; 


### Monday; 

Its allready 12:00, my updates for now are the following; 

- Allready set up the framework and linked the P5 libraries; Created to JS documents, the main struncture with the name /.sketch and the blob functionalities with the name /.blob
- I create the background and the white blob by implementing the functions setup, draw and blob and logging them. 
- 2:01 -- Create a function to move the blob over the different sides of the screen 
- I got how it worked and then completely fuckt up the code and cant really see the blob or the background


**Ending of Monday Outcome**; I couldt figure out what has been the problem on the background not showing, for tomorrow i will change the default setup so that i can have a clean black background
with a black blob, from there i will try to figure out what can be the the way to stablish a dinamic background. 


### Tuesday; 

So for today the outcomes were the following; 

- Got the Agar to start running over a red canvas and Move freely on an infite open space
- redistributed the mini-blobs so it could be more challenging to find and eat them


*challenges im facing at the moment*

- cant really change the background so its dynamic

### Wednesday; 

Objectives for today; 

Trying to define a trigger that sets the game and a short introduction of what are the rules od the game; It will be displayed on the lower part of the canvas where users will be able to see it and press any key to start the game; 


My second challenge is trying to look how to change the background of the game and the different blovs to try and make it funnier and introduce a different context to it, still trying to figure out what can be the best idea for the game, but thats not really important untill the mechanics are ready.
