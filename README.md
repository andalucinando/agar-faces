# Concept ideas; 

I want to create an agar.io of space combat. the game basically consists on creating a spaceship that shoots asteroids and doesnt get killed by hitting the asteroids. I want to name this game with some crazy name so its hypes the user to use the game before even trying it, cuz whenever you try it your hype is just going down! 

Are you ready?

Im also thinking on creating a last minute concept idea that will dratically change the concept of the game ex; instead of space i do it with birds. 


## Ideas for the name; 

-> "Super mortal kombat space fighters"
-> "space destruction mega nuclear"
-> "dark techno space death kombat"
-> "Ultra mega atomic space plutonium"
-> "Star wars on LSD"
-> "Star treck if Spok was born in Berlin"
-> "Space game"

## Update on the day to day; 


### Monday; 

Its allready 12:00, my updates for now are the following; 

- Allready set up the framework and linked the P5 libraries; Created to JS documents, the main struncture with the name /.sketch and the blob functionalities with the name /.blob
- I create the background and the white blob by implementing the functions setup, draw and blob and logging them. 
- 2:01 -- Create a function to move the blob over the different sides of the screen 
- I got how it worked and then completely fuckt up the code and cant really see the blob or the background


**Ending of Monday Outcome**; I couldt figure out what has been the problem on the background not showing, for tomorrow i will change the default setup so that i can have a clean black background
with a black blob, from there i will try to figure out what can be the the way to stablish a dinamic background. 


### Tuesday; 

So for today the outcomes were the following; 

- Got the Agar to start running over a red canvas and Move freely on an infite open space
- redistributed the mini-blobs so it could be more challenging to find and eat them


*challenges im facing at the moment*

- cant really change the background so its dynamic

### Wednesday; 

Objectives for today; 

Trying to define a trigger that sets the game and a short introduction of what are the rules od the game; It will be displayed on the lower part of the canvas where users will be able to see it and press any key to start the game; 


My second challenge is trying to look how to change the background of the game and the different blovs to try and make it funnier and introduce a different context to it, still trying to figure out what can be the best idea for the game, but thats not really important untill the mechanics are ready. 

Got to create the introduction of the game, for tomorrow ill try to get a fancy background to it and add key functionalities; 


### Thursday; 





## Friday! DEMO DAY; 


- What is this game about and why did i chose to do it? 

I want to create an agar.io of space combat. the game basically consists on creating a spaceship that shoots asteroids and doesnt get killed by hitting the asteroids. I want to name this game with some crazy name so its hypes the user to use the game before even trying it, cuz whenever you try it your hype is just going down! 

- Bigguest technical challenge, How did i solve it? 


     --> Getting the spaceship and the mini asteroids to change the background, the logic of the game was too complicated, but we could finally get it. 

    --> One challenge that i still didnt figure out how to do was the speed of the spaceship, how could i maintain the original speed of the spaceship for everytime it ate the blobs. 


- Biggest Mistake, what is my bigguest learning? 

    --> My biggiest mistake was realizing that i could not make the politicians and load all the photos from the database into the game, i believe that on my next game i will be able to take this learning to a next level and make cooler ideas. 

- Demo of the Game; Link of the Github page allready deployed!
